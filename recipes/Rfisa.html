		<h2> So what is this magical dish?</h2>
		<p>Rfisa is a traditional Moroccan dish made with shredded chicken and lentils,
			and served over layers of msemen or thin flatbread. </p>

		<h3> Ingredients </h3>
		<ul>
			<li>2-3 pounds of bone-in chicken pieces (legs and thighs work well)</li>
			<li>1 large onion, diced</li>
			<li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon grated ginger</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon turmeric</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
			<li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
			<li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
			<li>1 cup dried lentils, rinsed and drained</li>
			<li>6-8 cups of water or chicken broth</li>
			<li>Salt to taste</li>
			<li>4-6 msemen or thin flatbread sheets</li>
		</ul>
		<h3> Here starts the magic </h3>
		<ol>
			<li>In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat.
				 Add the diced onion and sauté until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
			<li>Add the minced garlic and grated ginger, and sauté for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
			<li>Add the chicken pieces to the pot, along with the turmeric, paprika, cumin, cinnamon, and black pepper.
				 Sauté the chicken for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it is lightly browned on all sides.</li>
			<li>Add the water or chicken broth to the pot, along with the rinsed and drained lentils.
				 Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cover the pot.
				 Let the chicken and lentils simmer for about 1 hour, until the chicken is cooked through and the lentils are tender.</li>
			<li>Remove the chicken pieces from the pot and set them aside to cool slightly. 
				Shred the meat off the bones and discard the bones and skin.</li>
			<li>Use an immersion blender or transfer the lentil mixture to a blender or food processor, and blend until smooth.
				 Return the pureed lentil mixture to the pot.</li>
			<li>Add the shredded chicken back to the pot and stir to combine.
				 Let the mixture simmer for an additional 15-20 minutes, until it has thickened to a stew-like consistency. Add salt to taste.</li>
			<li>Toast the almonds or sesame seeds in a dry pan over medium heat until lightly browned and fragrant.</li>
			<li>To serve, place a sheet of msemen or flatbread on a large serving platter. 
				Ladle some of the chicken and lentil mixture over the msemen, spreading it out to cover the entire sheet. 
				Repeat with the remaining sheets of msemen and chicken mixture, layering them on top of each other. 
				Top the final layer with the toasted almonds or sesame seeds and chopped parsley or cilantro, if desired.</li>
